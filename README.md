# TriviaGame

This project is a basic Trivia questions game. I chosed 90's movies theme for it. The game is time limited which is 90 seconds. As soon as you press the start button on the first page it goes to the question section (without reloading the page). You will see the timer appears at the top which gives you 90 seconds to answer all the questions. It is not necessary to answer all the questions. You can leave as many as you want. If you press the Done button within the 90 seconds, you will see your result on the screen. If your timer was up before you press the Done button,then you will see a result page which considered all the questions as unanswered.   

### Getting Started 

Please go to this URL: https://neginnami.github.io/TriviaGame
Try to answer all the questions in 90 seconds.

## Prerequisites & Installing

Just a web browser would be enough to run the game. I would recommend Google Chrome. You don't need to install anything extra.
 
### Running and test

Try to test the conditions of the game by waiting 90 seconds to see what happens if the timer becomes up. Also try to answer the questions within 90 seconds and see what happens.
